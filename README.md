Trulink
=======

A simple python to script to reveal true links of shortened links.

Special Thanks to www.urlxray.com

This simple script queries urlxray.com with a shortned link which then returns the actual true and longer link. Can be useful to see where a link actually leads to before clicking on it.

How To Use:

You can either query a single link or a file with a list of links. You cannot use both options at the same time.


For a single link

python Trulink.py -l <short link> 


For a file with a list of links

python Trulink.py -f <path to file>

Enjoy
